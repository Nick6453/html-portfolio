<h2>Best poem of all time</h2>
<p>Having survived the night of rhetoric and childhood<br />
I’m left with the image of the three of us:<br />
Mother, sister, daughter––an idea of progression––<br />
And idea abandoned at varying distances.<br />
The dream was the story of another way to live.<br />
As the characters assumed uncontrolled postures<br />
There you were among them, knowing what you wanted.<br />
